_Example astronomy data analysis problems tackled using probabilistic models_

The goal of this project is to collect examples of real(istic) astronomy data analysis problems that are well suited as introductions to various probabilistic modeling and inference techniques.
We (/I) so often fall back on fitting a line to data as my test case, which is okay but not that compelling.
I hope that these examples will demonstrate the use of these techniques and also expose the astronomical community to tools and techniques that aren't yet widely used.
I'm hoping to implement each example using several different packages (probably primary Python-based for now with room for expansion), not with the goal of comparing the packages, but just to demontrate the different approaches and terminology used by practitioners.

**Help needed**: Please open issues or pull requests if you have suggestions for good sample problems or corrections to existing examples.

## Examples (a work in progress)

- [ ] Fitting a line

## Outline

1. Some background, terminology, and motivation
2. Introduction to probabilistic modeling
3. Introduction to inference methods (MCMC, variational inference, convergence/diagnostics)
4. _Other technical topics?_
5. Introduction to various packages (emcee, dynesty, polychord, pymc3, numpyro, stan, etc.)
